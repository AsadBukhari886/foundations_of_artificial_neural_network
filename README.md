# Foundations of Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains structured learning material and practical
implementations for understanding the **foundations of Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs)**.\
It is designed for students, beginners, and self-learners who want to
build strong conceptual and practical knowledge of neural networks from
scratch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About This Repository

The repository includes:

-   **Jupyter Notebooks (Class-wise lectures)** covering core ANN
    concepts\
-   **NumPy-focused Google Colab notebooks** (inside the `numpy/`
    folder)\
-   **Written notes** (available via external Google Drive link)\
-   Clear commit messages describing the purpose of each uploaded
    file

This project serves as a structured course-style resource for mastering
neural network fundamentals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics Covered

The notebooks progressively cover key concepts such as:

-   Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks\
-   Biological vs Artificial Neurons\
-   Perceptron Model\
-   Activation Functions\
-   Feedforward Neural Networks\
-   Forward Propagation\
-   Loss Functions\
-   Backpropagation Algorithm\
-   Gradient Descent\
-   Weight Updates and Optimization\
-   Mathematical Foundations behind ANN

Each notebook corresponds to specific class sessions and builds upon
previous concepts.

## NumPy Folder Explanation

The `numpy/` directory contains **three Google Colab notebooks**
specifically created to strengthen understanding of:

-   NumPy arrays
-   Mathematical operations
-   Vectorization
-   Matrix operations
-   Linear algebra foundations required for neural networks

These notebooks focus purely on NumPy because a strong understanding of
NumPy is essential before implementing neural networks from scratch.

Each notebook's purpose and role are clearly described in the **commit
messages**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Written Notes

Comprehensive written notes have also been prepared to support the
notebooks.

These notes explain:

-   Mathematical derivations\
-   Step-by-step algorithm breakdowns\
-   Conceptual explanations\
-   Formula interpretations

The notes are accessible via the provided **Google Drive link**.
